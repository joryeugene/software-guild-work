Given a String, return a new String where "not " has been added to the front. However, if the String already begins with "not", return the String unchanged.

Hint: Look up how to use "SubString" in c#

notString("candy") -> "not candy"
notString("x") -> "not x"
notString("not bad") -> "not bad"

public String notString(String s) {

}
