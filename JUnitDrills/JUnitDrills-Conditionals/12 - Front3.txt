Given a String, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the String. If the String length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. Return a new String which is 3 copies of the front. 

front3("Microsoft") -> "MicMicMic"
front3("Chocolate") -> "ChoChoCho"
front3("at") -> "atatat"

public String front3(String str) {

}
