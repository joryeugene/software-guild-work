Given a String, return the count of the number of times that a subString length 2 appears in the String and also as the last 2 chars of the String, so "hixxxhi" yields 1 (we won't count the end subString). 

countLast2("hixxhi") -> 1
countLast2("xaxxaxaxx") -> 1
countLast2("axxxaaxx") -> 2

public int countLast2(String str) {

}
